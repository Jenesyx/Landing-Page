                    Vue.js allows you to simply bind your data models to the
                representation layer. It also allows you to easily reuse
                components throughout the application.

                You don't need to create special models or collections and to
                register events object in there. You don't need to follow some
                special syntax. You don't need to install any of never-ending
                dependencies.

                Your models are plain JavaScript objects. They are being bound
                to whatever you want in your Views (text, input text, classes,
                attributes, and so on), and it just works.
